# A Story Map App on Dengue Fever in Singapore

## Project Outline

For our Javascript midterm submission, we had to create a story map application for a dataset of our choosing. A story map tells a story through several slides, each slide combining text and data. The user is able to move forward and backwards through the slides by clicking on next and previous buttons.

This framework could be exceptionally useful in communicating ideas/stories in a linear sequence.

## Datasets
I used three datasets from [Data.gov.sg](http://data.gov.sg)
- [Dengue Clusters](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/dengue-clusters)
- [Dengue Cases](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/dengue-cases)
- [Dengue Mosquito Breeding Habitats](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/dengue-mosquito-breeding-habitats)

The downloaded files were then converted in geojson using [geojson.io](http://geojson.io)
