# A Story Map App on Dengue Fever in Singapore

## Project Outline

For our Javascript midterm submission, we had to create a story map application for a dataset of our choosing. A story map tells a story through several slides, each slide combining text and data. The user is able to move forward and backwards through the slides by clicking on next and previous buttons.


## Dataset
I used three datasets from [Data.gov.sg](http://data.gov.sg)
- [Dengue Clusters](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/dengue-clusters)
- [Dengue Cases](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/dengue-cases)
- [Dengue Mosquito Breeding Habitats](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/dengue-mosquito-breeding-habitats)

The downloaded files were then converted in geojson using [geojson.io](http://geojson.io)
